# EDAM-bioimaging

An ontology of bioimage informatics operations, types of data, data formats, and bioimaging topics

Please see README.md for more details, including viewing and download.



## Contributing

This is an open community project (transparent and participatory), and thus contributions are very welcome!

The most accessible way of contributing is writing comments with suggestions or needs for clarification, and starting discussion threads. Multiple channels are avaialable:

**Preferred:**
* Add __comments__ to the [live development version of EDAM-bioimaging](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/2ce704bf-83ed-4d2e-985f-84c4841fac71/edit/Classes) at __WebProtégé__. Free registration at WebProtégé is required. Select a concept and "Start new thread" in the "Comments" widget|window (not "Comments" tab, stay in the "Classes" tab). Contribute to already open threads _ibid_ or in the "Comments" tab.

**Other options:**
* Submit or comment on an [__issue__](https://github.com/edamontology/edam-bioimaging/issues) at __GitHub__
* Create a __pull request__ to https://github.com/edamontology/edam-bioimaging
* Add a proposal or comment to EDAM-bioimaging at the __NCBO BioPortal__
    * to a selected concept in the ["Classes" tab](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING/?p=classes) by clicking the small "Notes" tab on the right (still within the big "Classes" tab)
    * on the general level in the ["Notes" tab](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING/?p=notes). You can include new concept proposals here.
* Join the discussions at wg4-edam_ontology@irbbarcelona.org.glip.com (if member of, or invited to NeuBIAS on [Glip](https://app.glip.com/)). Mostly organisational stuff.
* Add comments to the stable versions of EDAM-bioimaging at WebProtégé, such as the [last stable version](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/60fbe82b-bd58-41e2-825d-3801c071ee47/edit/Classes) and especially the frozen versions ([alpha06](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/c149e738-4437-456c-843c-eb5861a36854/edit/Classes), [alpha05](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/d9f9a5b2-d746-430a-a2cd-9aa745764079/edit/Classes), [alpha04](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/861eadbe-8e38-46fc-a59e-6d45a1b6f25e/edit/Classes), [alpha03](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/40a89525-b6d6-42f2-a4c1-88e7fb1c1f86/edit/Classes), [alpha02](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/f2cd721e-0f26-4b05-9ce2-ce20d4860442/edit/Classes)) for more persistent comments. Note that comments to the [live version](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/2ce704bf-83ed-4d2e-985f-84c4841fac71/edit/Classes) are handled with the highest priority.

If you want to contribute in person, please join or organise a hackathon. Get in touch with wg4-edam_ontology@irbbarcelona.org.glip.com or matus.kalas@uib.no for planning. Usual hackathons for editing EDAM-bioimaging are the [NEUBIAS Taggathons](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/what-is-taggathon/).


## Editing

At this momentary early stage of the development, the content of EDAM-bioimaging is developed collaboratively at http://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/2ce704bf-83ed-4d2e-985f-84c4841fac71/edit/Classes. After one dev cycle, these developments are commited in a batch to _git_. _Vice versa_, commits from _git_ are merged into WebProtégé.

**_N.B._:** Due to this special setup, edit either:
* in only _git_ or in only WebProtégé and merge afterwards
* or if needed in parallel, edit properties and root concepts only in _git_ and other concepts only in WebProtégé. Merge afterwards.

**_N.B._:** Be aware of how IDs of new concepts are assigned, and what it means for both **merging into _git_** and **[Comments](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/2ce704bf-83ed-4d2e-985f-84c4841fac71/edit/Comments) in WebProtégé**.
